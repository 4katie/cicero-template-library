The shipment must contain between 3000 and 3500 KG of \"Grade I, Size 4, Zutano Mexican Avocados\".\r\n\r\nShipping containers used must be temperature controlled, and temperature readings must be logged at least 1 per HOUR.\r\n\r\nShipments that arrive after 04/02/2018 are to be considered spoiled and must be arranged to be returned to or disposed of by grower at cost to grower.\r\n\r\nShipments that have a temperature reading less than the agreed minimum temperature of 2 degrees centigrade have a price penalty applied calculated using Formula 1 below. The minimum breach penalty factor to be used is 0.2.\r\n\r\nShipments that have a temperature reading greater than the agreed maximum temperature of 13 degrees centigrade have a price penalty applied calculated using Formula 2 below. The maximum breach penalty factor to be used is 0.15.\r\n\r\nFormula 1: Maximum Temperature Breach Penalty:\r\n   penalty = number of shipment units x difference between maximum temperature and agreed maximum temperature x maximum breach penalty factor\r\n\r\nFormula 2: Minimum Temperature Breach Penalty:\r\n   penalty = number of shipment units x difference between minimum temperature and agreed minimum temperature x minimum breach penalty factor\r\n",
