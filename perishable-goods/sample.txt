On receipt of the shipment "SHIP_001" the importer "DAN" pays the grower "PETER" 1.50 USD per KG. The shipment must contain between 3000 and 3500 KG of "Grade I, Size 4, Zutano Mexican Avocados".

Shipping containers used must be temperature controlled, and temperature readings must be logged at least 1 per HOUR.

Shipments that arrive after 04/02/2018 are to be considered spoiled and are free.

Shipments that have a temperature reading less than the agreed minimum temperate of 2 degrees centigrade have a cost penalty applied calculated using Formula 1 below. The minimum breach penalty factor to be be used is 0.2.

Shipments that have a temperature reading greater than the agreed maximum temperate of 13 degrees centigrade have a cost penalty applied calculated using Formula 2 below. The maximum breach penalty factor to be be used is 0.15.

Formula 1: Maximum Temperature Breach Penalty:
   absolute max temperature delta = |maximum temperature - agreed maximum temperature|
   penalty = number of shipment units x absolute max temperature delta x maximum breach penalty factor

Formula 2: Minimum Temperature Breach Penalty:
   absolute min temperature delta = |minimum temperature - agreed minimum temperature|
   penalty = number of shipment units x absolute min temperature delta x minimum breach penalty factor
